TODO
----
- syntactic sugar for other testfkws:
  * Mocha
  * QUnit

* Performance if the browser-tab is in the background:
  - In chrome, executing ui tests via karma is slow if
    the browser-tab is in the background (i.e. another tab is open and focused).

* Better error handling:
  - error event listener for general errors in iframes
  - how to report? On the next call to ready/inject/...?
